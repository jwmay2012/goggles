### Amazon Affiliate Review Spam
Discard sites that are low effort review spam.  
Sites that may have been automatically generated with popular amazon product links and descriptions for the purpose of generating affiliate income.
Not genuine or helpful reviews.

Signs a site may be review spam.
- 5+ different links for the same product type that really should only have 2 or 3 options. "Top 10 Toaster Ovens", "Best 7 rectal thermometors", etc. A person with an opinionated review will only come to the conclusion that a single product is their favorite. They could justify another recommended product based on price (much higher or much lower), or perhaps a significant use case differing on personal preference. No one needs a "Top 10 arc candle lighters" list.
- incorherent or contradictory item recommendations/pros/cons (TODO: example)
- bad, low effort recommendations. even is a site has few product options, if one or more of the recommendations is clearly bad, it's low effort affiliate spam. Do cross reviews of products. If they seem to be giving recommendations for products that have easily discoverable negatives without addressing them, that's a red flag. Some sites have wised up to the "top 10" brute force method, and limit to 4 options of a product type. They usually list the most popular on amazon.
